# Tailwind-Landing-Page
product landing page using tailwind and daisyui
 
I made a product landing page for a custom keyboard coming out on KBDFans. I wanted to make a landing page
for something I have some interest in just to make the project more enjoyable. The landing page was made with
tailwindcss which really expedited the entire process and especially helping with responsivness. This is only
my second project using tailwind so i am sure i will get more efficient as time goes on.

Overall this project was lots of fun and im glad that i was able to build a project that showed a bit of my
personal interest and hobbies. Building this landing page made me feel that my undrestanding of web development and design has grown
exponentially over the past few months.
